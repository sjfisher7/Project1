# Project1
##What is this repo or project? 

This project is an assignment for my Cybersecurity class. The project is highlighting the following:

Bash Scripting

Using Vagrant and VMWare to create a linux Virtual Machine. Learned Bash in the Terminal within that VM. This showed us how to make changes to linux using only the command prompt. 

How I can use Azure to Create:
Virtual Machines
Ansible 
Docker Containers
Elk Stack

Network Diagrams
These diagrams show how I created the virtual enviroment in Azure.


##How does it work?

I will go through the different folders, each represent one section of information. The first is Linux and using Bash. The second is Ansible, and everything I did to set up the Azure environment. The last folder is the diagrams for the Ansible section. 

During the week with Linux we used Vagrant and VMware to create a virtual machine running linux. The rest of the time we learned different bash scripting to navagate around and change settings in linux.

The week Cloud Computing week we used Azure to create VM's to run our Docker containers, Ansible, and Elk Stack. Connected all of them through Azure to get information transfered. Also set up Filebeat container and metricbeat containers to obtain info for Kibana. 

##Who will use this repo or project?

This project will go live to show possible future employers what I have learned and what I can accomplish. Its easier to see the work I have done previously verses trying to explain all the parts that it took to come up with the project as a whole. This is true of most IT positions. If others would like to use the outline as a template for future projects that would be nice as well. 


##What is the goal of this project?

My goal with this project is to:

A. Complete the assignment for a Homework grade.

B. Have something I can show potential employers, allowing them to see different skills that I have learned. This will also show how I might be of value to a company with me as an employee. 

C. Have something along with my resume to show employers. I am working on changing careers and this will be very helpful since I don't have a ton of real world experience.
