This project is an assignment for my Cybersecurity class. The project is highlighting the following:


How to Create Virtual Machines Ansible Docker Containers Elk Stack within Azure.

Network Diagrams These diagrams show how I created the virtual enviroment in Azure.

The files have been tested and used to create a live ELK deployment within Azure. You can use it to recreate the entire deployment or you can use portions of the Ansible files, such as Filebeat. 

The purpose of the project was to expose a load balanced instance of DVWA, load balancing allowed the application to be highly monitored as well as having restricting access to the network. 
A jump box is a secure computer that can be used as a single point of entry to the server, this keeps access from the pubilc internet. Only the jump box can accept connections from the internet and this can be set to only be accessed by designated IP addresses. By using an ELK server we can monitor changes to the system and server logs. By using Filebeat and Metricbeat we can collect the data needed and it can be shown to us through Kibana.
